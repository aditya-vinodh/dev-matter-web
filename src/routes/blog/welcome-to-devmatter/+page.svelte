			<p>
				As a solo developer, Iâ€™ve often found myself rebuilding the same backend tools over and over
				again â€” especially for handling user interactions like signups, contact forms, and feedback.
				I wanted a simple way to collect data and get notified when something important happened.
				But existing solutions like email and Slack werenâ€™t cutting it â€” messages would get lost,
				cluttered, or buried in threads.
			</p>

			<p>
				So I built DevMatter â€” a modern, developer-focused tool to help manage your apps more
				efficiently, starting with one core feature: Forms.
			</p>

			<h2 class="text-xl font-medium tracking-tight text-zinc-900">
				The Form API Built for Developers
			</h2>

			<p>
				DevMatter makes it simple to collect and manage user-submitted data. Whether itâ€™s a contact
				form, support request, survey, or feedback form, DevMatter helps you stay on top of what
				your users are saying â€” without rebuilding the backend every time.
			</p>

			<div class="flex flex-col">
				<p>Hereâ€™s what you get:</p>
				<ul class="list-disc pl-3 *:text-pretty">
					<li>
						<strong class="font-medium text-zinc-900">Custom forms</strong>: Design and integrate
						your own forms â€” no bloated UI builders or templates
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong class="font-medium text-zinc-900">Simple API</strong>: Submit form data directly
						to our endpoints. We handle storage and delivery.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong class="font-medium text-zinc-900">Instant notifications</strong>: Get real-time
						push notifications through our clean mobile app.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong class="font-medium text-zinc-900">Stay on top of your messages</strong>: View
						and respond to submissions on the go.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<p>Itâ€™s fast to set up, easy to use, and built with developer experience in mind.</p>

			<h2 class="text-xl font-medium tracking-tight">Why I Built It</h2>

			<p>
				I wanted a tool that fit into my workflow, didnâ€™t overwhelm me with features I didnâ€™t use,
				and made it effortless to stay in the loop when someone reached out through my app.
			</p>

			<p>
				DevMatter is my attempt to fix that â€” a lightweight backend with real-time mobile alerts and
				a clean UI that respects your time.
			</p>

			<h2 class="text-xl font-medium tracking-tight">Whatâ€™s Next?</h2>

			<p>
				Forms are just the beginning. I have many features planned â€” all centered around helping
				developers manage their apps more effectively. But I want to build this alongside other devs
				who feel the same pain I did.
			</p>

			<p>If this sounds useful to you, Iâ€™d love for you to try it out and share your feedback.</p>

				Let me know what you think, and if youâ€™d like access to the mobile app for push
				notifications, DM me or reach out through the <a href="/contact" class="underline"
