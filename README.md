# DevMatter

A better way to manage your apps!

I've been working on this project as an easy way to manage my own apps. I have a lot of ideas for things I want to build, so naturally I am working on multiple projects simultaneously. There are a lot of trivial yet annoying things I need to do every time I build software to manage and monitor it. So, I decided to build __DevMatter__, a lightweight app that you can easily self-host to manage repeated and trivial tasks you might encounter.

The most important thing I wanted was a way for me to send form data somewhere so that I can easily view it later and be notified when submissions occur. I couldn't find an existing solution that gave the flexbility of customizing and integrating the form with my apps that way I liked, and none had convenient options to view them on the go. Thus, that is the first feature I built!

# Features

1. Forms

An extremely simple API that allows you to create forms with a schema that you define, and save submissions programatically. You get to control the entire form experience, and deal with the data later however you like.

Get notified on the go using a clean mobile app experience. (Starting with iOS only. Will expand to Android if there is sufficient interest)

2. _More features coming soon..._

# Get started

Head over to [Dev Matter](https://devmatter.app) to start building using our cloud-hosted version.

Or, self-host it using Docker `adityavinodh/dev-matter`
